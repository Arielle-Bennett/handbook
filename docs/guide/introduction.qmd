Welcome to our Contributor Experience Guide!

The purpose of this guide is to clarify themes, provide tools, outline 
frameworks, and hopefully, it will grow to be much more than that in the future!

To get us started we divided it into 5 sections:

- **Contributor Experience Guide**: the big picture, how we think about this role
- **Governance Guide**: guidance to lead discussions and support pathways for 
  contributions
- **Collaboration Guide**: organizational templates for various meeting and 
  events, how to bring people together and when various programs are 
  effective (or what for)
- **Communication Guide**: communication platforms, and techniques
- **Tools Collections**: Tools we love to use to support our work and a collection of 
  templates from various sections for easy navigation
